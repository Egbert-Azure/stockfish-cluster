# Connecting to a Remote Chess Engine with SSHEngine

SSHEngine is a tool developed by Matt Nohr, a developer and chess player, to simplify the process of connecting a chess GUI to a remote chess engine via SSH. This tool can be found on Gitlab and is designed to work with standard SSH connections, allowing users to connect to a remote server that has a chess engine installed, such as Stockfish.

In contrast to Option 1 of this guide, SSHEngine offers a more straightforward solution to the problem of connecting a chess GUI to a remote chess engine. With SSHEngine, users can create a configuration file to easily modify connection options, including the host address, without the need to use PuTTY or convert SSH keys.

To get started with SSHEngine, download and unzip the tool to a folder of your choice, such as "EngineCluster." Next, create a configuration file called engine.yml in the same directory with the following entries:

``` vbnet
host: your.remote.host.com
user: your_username
key_file: /path/to/your/private/key
engine_path: /path/to/stockfish
```

In this configuration file, replace your.remote.host.com with the address of your remote server, your_username with your username for the remote server, /path/to/your/private/key with the path to your SSH private key, and /path/to/stockfish with the path to the chess engine you want to use, such as Stockfish.

Once the configuration file is set up, you can run the SSHEngine program from different directories for different connections. With this tool, you can easily connect your chess GUI to a remote chess engine and enjoy the benefits of powerful analysis and gameplay.
